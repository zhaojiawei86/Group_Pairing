Solution for p2a

Better grouping for example given by p2a:

- 1st group: users 0 and 1
- 2nd group: user 3 and 4
- 3rd group: user 2

This gives a grand total of:

- 1st group: R[0,1]+R[1,0] = 100
- 2nd group: R[3,4] +R[4,3]= 125
- 3rd group: 0

100 + 125 = 225 which is a better grouping than example (130).
