There are better grouping ways. One better way to group the users is to put:

- users 0 and 1 in the first group
- user 2 in the second group, and
- user 3 and user 4 in the last group.

This group has a *total ranking* of:

- R[0,1]+R[1,0] = 100, for the first group. 
- 0 for the second group
- R[3,4] +R[4,3]= 125 for the last group.

This gives a total of 225.
